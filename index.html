            she gave everything to the projects she worked on this year and
            learned so much from her collaborators.As she shared, "I've never
            felt more pride or joy or love while simultaneously feeling so
            deeply misunderstood by people who don't know me, who piece whispers
            together and make what they want out of me and their assumptions of
            my life."I have learned how much more important one of those things
            is than the other," she added. "I have never felt more tightly held
            or fiercely protected by those who love and understand me (friends,
            family, and fans alike). Grande also acknowledged her personal
            growth, sharing that she now feels safe in situations she'd normally
            be fearful of.
